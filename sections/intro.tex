Massive MIMO is a promising technology for the 5G wireless communication system. Thanks to the excess amount of antennas in the base station (BS), massive MIMO is capable of providing an order of spatial multiplexing gain as compared to the legacy system by simple linear signal processing algorithms \cite{marzetta2010noncooperative}. 
This multiplexing gain is harvested when coherently combines the data signal with the linear signal processing from the channel state information (CSI).

The acquisition of CSI is considered as the central activity in massive MIMO. In a time-division duplex (TDD) system, one can rely on channel reciprocity to obtain downlink CSI efficiently from sending uplink pilot sequences with the length proportional to the number of active user equipments (UEs). It is vital that the coherent combining gain can only be exploited in the finite channel coherence block. Therefore the duration of a frame packet which consists of pilot, uplink and downlink data is usually limit to the coherent time. To maximize the spectral efficiency (SE), the channel resource utilizes for pilot should be designed economically. However, when the length of the pilot sequence is limited, the number of orthogonal pilot codes is limited accordingly. The unavoidable pilot reuse among cells for massive MIMO transmission, where within the cell use orthogonal pilots,
while the same set of orthogonal pilots is reused among cells results in the pilot contamination. Pilot contamination caused by inter-cell pilot reuse is always describes as the limit factor of SE for massive MIMO\cite{marzetta2010noncooperative,jose2011pilot}. 

The two main impacts caused by pilot contamination include: first, the channel estimation degrades due to the pilot interference; second, the contaminated channel combines coherently both desired and interfered signals during the data transmission. Therefore, although with the excess number of antenna, noise, fast fading and intra-cell interference are vanished, the inter-cell interference from pilot contamination cannot be eliminated and limit the SE\cite{marzetta2010noncooperative,bjornson2017massive}. 

Many work have been proposed about mitigating pilot contamination also known as pilot decontamination. The focus of this paper will be in the category of pilot-based estimation approach\cite{elijah2016comprehensive}\footnote{Subspace-based estimation approach is out of our scope as their accuracy depends on large number of antennas and the sampling rate in the coherence time\cite{elijah2016comprehensive}.}. Pilot sequence allocation for inter-cell users with different channel support has been proposed in\cite{yin2013coordinated,adhikary2013joint,you2015pilot}. This method utilizes channel covariance matrices of both desired and interfering UEs. It has significant improvement but only for channels with orthogonal support. Furthermore, this method assumes the individual channel covariance information has been available in advance. In \cite{bjornson2016massive}, the authors showed that to have individual channel covariance is not necessary in improving channel estimation. By a two-stage estimation procedure, one can collect the summation of channel covariance from UEs which caused pilot contamination with some extra pilot overhead. However, as they do not collect individual channel information, this method still could not deal channels with overlapping support. In \cite{ngo2017cell}, a greedy pilot scheduling was proposed. In each iteration, the algorithm first checks the UE with the lowest SE. Then, updates the pilot assignment to schedule away that UE. This procedure iterates until all UEs meet their SE criterion. Two concerns of this method include: First, the rescheduling is not time efficient and accurate. The pilot reallocation is triggered by assuming the bad SE is due to pilot contamination. Second, without individual channel information, the system still cannot avoid interference which might coherently combined in the data transmission phase. In summary, most of the research work focus on improving channel estimation by either Bayesian estimation or greedy pilot rescheduling. The Bayesian estimation improves significantly if there is no overlapping in the channel support. When it combines with the greedy pilot rescheduling, eventually the UEs with different angular support might be scheduled together in the data phase. 

From the related work, we have two findings: First, there is still no good existing method of detecting if the UEs which are scheduled in the same pilot codes have high or low channel support efficiently. Our argument is that relying on greedy scheduling, there is still a big delay until the criterion in SE is met which is highly dependent to the propagation environment. 
%Moreover, the number of iterations is highly dependent to the environment. 
We therefore propose to apply a deep learning model on the contaminated pilots and detect if there is high probability of angular support correlation. With this, we can reschedule the pilot sequences in an earlier phase precisely. Second, a key point here is that if the UEs have similar channel support, by rescheduling their pilots, one can improve the channel estimation, but cannot avoid the high channel correlation in the data transmission. Instead of reschedule the pilot to improve channel estimation, one might even have to drop the UE which might potentially cause high inter-cell interference during the data transmission.  %The authors in \cite{fernandes2013inter} proposed a time-shifted pilot allocation protocol. By joint frame scheduling with neighboring cells, uplink pilot of self cell overlaps only with downlink precoded data in the other cells. The only pilot contamination source comes only from the neighboring BSs, and hence the interference is less critical as in the data phase does not combined coherently. However, it is very challenging to joint schedule the traffic planning among multiple cells.
We summarize our contributions and challenges as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item We address the impact of pilot contamination with a system model. A special highlight from the impact of a coherently combined interference is given (Section II). 

\item We propose a deep learning assistant channel estimation improvement algorithm under pilot contamination (Section III). In \cite{Chen2018pilot}, we have verified that channel measured from a real propagation environment, the angular support from one UE can be much more complicated than a simple one-ring model. It it extremely difficult to distinguish if the two channels are from similar angles. An important conclusion is that there is a high correlation of the channel support to the contaminated channel estimation error. We proposed to apply deep learning to separate the contaminated channel information. By separating the angular information, we can schedule away the two users who shared very similar angular support.

\item We improve the SE by comparing the channel correlation of all intra and inter-cell users (Section III). Traditional pilot rescheduling only improves channel estimation but cannot avoid the coherent combining of the interference UEs.
\item We measure the channel to demonstrate in the later section that our deep learning model can handle also complicated channels (Section IV). 
\item We compare the channel estimation improvement with the machine learning assistant algorithm to the traditional method. We run a system level simulation with one-ring model and also our measured channel to demonstrate the advantages of applying pilot and user scheduling (Section V).

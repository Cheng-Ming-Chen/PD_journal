In a cellular network, massive MIMO systems of $L$ cells, where a single BS per cell equipped 
with $M$ antennas is considered. %and 
%serves simultaneously to $K_A$ active UEs. 
In this full spectrum reuse cellular systems, there are in total $K$ UEs in the UE set, i.e., $K_l\triangleq\{1,...,K\}$ in each cell $l$. The $k_{th}$ element in set $K_l$ is represented as $K_l[k]$. Moreover, within this set, a number of $K_A$ active UEs in the subset $A_l$, $A_l\subset K_l$, are selected to be served in some coherent blocks. Note that in this multi-cell network, the pilot sequence used by single-antenna UEs in the same
cell are assumed to be mutually orthogonal. Moreover, we assume the BSs are all synchronized in time and the pilot, UL and DL data are all aligned in the network.\footnote{There are many alternative frame structures. For example, to superimpose the pilot subframe of one cell to the  UL data subframe of the neighboring cells\cite{upadhya2017superimposed}. Alternatively, some cells send UL pilots, while the others send DL data \cite{fernandes2013inter}. As in this paper, rather than relying on adjusting the sequence length so as to decorrelate the channel estimation, we aim to collect the channel information wisely for pilot decontamination. Therefore, we choose to align all frame structures.} 
\subsection{Physical channel representation}
The channel frequency response $\mathbf{h}_{jA_j[k]}(f)\in\mathbb{C}^{M}$ from UE $A_j[k]$ to BS $j$ at subcarrier $f$ with a correlation $\mathbf{R}_{jA_{j}[k]}$ due to finite multipath angular spread at the BS  can be represented as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_{jA_{j}[k]}(f)=\beta^{\frac{1}{2}}_{jA_{j}[k]}\mathbf{g}_{jA_{j}[k]}(f),\;-\frac{W}{2}\leq f\leq \frac{W}{2},
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ denotes the large scale fading and $W$ is the two-sided bandwidth. $\mathbf{g}$ stands for the small scale fading, which can be represented as
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{g}_{jA_{j}[k]}(f)=\sum_{n=1}^{N_{path}}\alpha_{n}\mathbf{a}(\varphi_n,\theta_n)e^{-j2\pi\tau_{n}f},
\end{equation}
where $N_{path}$ %is 
stands for the number of multipath components, $\alpha_n$  %denotes the complex number with different 
represents the amplitude and phase of the $n_{th}$ multipath and $\tau_n$ represents the path-delay of the $n_{th}$ multipath and is within the delay spread $[0,\tau_{DS}]$. 
%\begin{equation}
%\mathbf{h}_{jA_{j}[k]}=\beta^{1/2}_{jA_{j}[k]}\mathbf{R}_{jA_{j}[k]}^{1/2}\mathbf{h}_{W},
%\end{equation}
$\mathbf{R}_{jA_{j}[k]}$ is the second order channel covariance matrix which exploits the spatial properties and frequency-selectivity to analyze the channel properties and is defined as $\mathbf{R}_{jA_j[k]}=\E_f{({\mathbf{g}}_{jA_j[k]}(f){\mathbf{g}}_{jA_j[k]}^H(f))}$ with a normalization $tr(\mathbf{R})=M$. The gain variation among antennas as studied in\cite{chen2017finite} is kept even with the normalization. To explain the steering vector $\mathbf{a}$, let $N$ be the number of equally divided antennas in two rectangular arrays\footnote{The purpose is to match with our designed two 32-antennas arrays.}, with $N_1$ and $N_2$ antennas in azimuthal and elevation dimensions, respectively. Thus, $M=2N=2(N_1N_2)$. The  steering vector of a two dimensional (2D) array can be constructed as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a}(\varphi,\theta)=vec\big\{\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}\big\},
\label{eq:steervector}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{u}=[1,e^{-j2\pi \alpha\sin\varphi\sin\theta},...,e^{-j2\pi \alpha (N_1-1)\sin\varphi\sin\theta}]^T, \\
\mathbf{v}=[1,e^{-j2\pi \alpha\cos\varphi\sin\theta},...,e^{-j2\pi \alpha(N_2-1)\cos\varphi\sin\theta}]^T.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$\alpha$, $\varphi$ and $\theta$ are the normalized antenna spacing in %unit 
%of
wavelength, azimuthal angle and elevation angle, respectively. The detail of the 2D  multiple signal classifi-
cation (MUSIC) transformation can be referred to \cite{Chen2018pilot}\footnote{The difference to the previous work, here we modify the steering vector to match with the spherical coordination.}.%The covariance matrix $R$ can be from measured channel or the local scattering spatial correlation model\cite{bjornson2017massive}. Moreover, $\mathbf{h}_{W}\sim \mathcal{CN}\left(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}_M\right)$ stands for zero-mean complex Gaussian distribution with covariance $\mathbf{I}_M$. 

\subsection{CSI at the BS receiver}
A pilot sequence $\mathbf{\phi}_{A_j[k]}\in \mathbb{C}^{\tau} $ is transmitted by the $k_{th}$ UE in the UE set $A_j$ for the UL channel estimation. $\tau$ denotes the length of pilot sequence in a coherence block, and sequence $\mathbf{{\phi}}$ which fulfills the constraint $\left\Vert\mathbf{\phi}\right\Vert^2=\tau$ is scaled by UE's transmit power $\sqrt{p}$ \footnote{Here we assume all UEs transmit the same power. }. As an orthogonal pilot codebook is assumed here, for two different pilot sequences, there is zero cross-correlation.  The received matrix in the $j_{th}$ BS is represented as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Yj}
\mathbf{Y}_j = \sqrt{p}\Big(\underbrace{\sum_{k = 1}^{K_A} \mathbf{h}_{jA_j[k]} \mathbf{\phi}_{A_j[k]}^T}_\text{Desired pilots} +\underbrace{\sum_{\substack{l=1 \\ l\neq j}}^{L}\sum_{k = 1}^{K_A} \mathbf{h}_{jA_l[k]} \mathbf{\phi}_{A_l[k]}^T}_\text{Inter-cell pilots}\Big) + \mathbf{N},   
\end{equation}
%where $\mathbf{h}_{jU_j[k]}\in\mathbb{C}^{M}$ stands for channel from UE $U_j[k]$ to BS $j$ and 
By normalizing the average channel attenuation $\beta$ by noise power, i.e., setting $\beta$ as $\beta/\sigma^2_{noise}$, the noise $\mathbf{N}$ can be represented as the independent identically distributed
(i.i.d.) complex Gaussian with elements distributed as $\mathcal{CN\left(\mathit{0,1}\right)}$.
The BS then correlates the received pilot with $\mathbf{\phi}_{A_j[k]}^*$ to obtain the channel observation of $\mathbf{h}_{jA_j[k]}$:%.
\begin{equation} 
\mathbf{y}_{jA_j[k]} = \tau\sqrt{p}\Big(\underbrace{\mathbf{h}_{jA_j[k]}}_\text{Desired pilot} +\underbrace{\sum_{A_l[s]\in \\ \zeta\char`\\\{(l,s) = (j,k)\}}\mathbf{h}_{jA_l[s]}}_\text{Interfering pilots}\Big) + \tilde{\mathbf{n}}.   \label{eq:pilot contamination}
\end{equation}
Let $\zeta$ denotes a pilot reuse set which includes all UEs that share a common pilot sequence and can be defined as
\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
\zeta \subseteq \{A_l[s]:\mathbf{\phi}_{A_j[k]}^T \mathbf{\phi}_{A_l[s]}^*=\tau, \{l=1,...,L;s=1,...,K_A\}\}.
%\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Moreover, $\char`\\$ stands for excluding elements in the set. As shown in (\ref{eq:pilot contamination}), the interfering channel from the neighboring cells leak directly to the desired estimate.

\subsection{The Antenna Averaged Correlation Coefficient}
We temporarily assume that the second order channel covariance matrices are available. \cm{we will discuss this later}
In order to find the correlation metric for the desired and interfering channels as an input to the deep learning model, we first look only at the channel estimation of the desired UE.
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{h}}^{Bay}_{jA_j[k]} = \sqrt{p}\mathbf{R}_{jA_j[k]} \mathbf{\Psi}_{jA_j[k]} \mathbf{y}_{jA_j[k]}, 
\end{equation}
where the superscript $Bay$ stands for the Bayesian channel estimation %, $\sigma_{n}^{2}$ is the variance of regularized noise 
and $\mathbf{\Psi}_{jA_j[k]}$ is defined as

%\begin{equation}
%\mathbf{\Psi}_{jA_j[k]} = \Bigg(\tau\:{p}\sum_{A_l[s]\in\zeta} \mathbf{R}_{j,A_l[s]} + \sigma^2_n \mathbf{I}_M\Bigg)^{-1}.
%\label{eq:psi_function}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\Psi}_{jA_j[k]} = \Bigg(\tau\:{p}\sum_{A_l[s]\in\zeta} \mathbf{R}_{j,A_l[s]} + \mathbf{I}_M\Bigg)^{-1}.
\label{eq:psi_function}
\end{equation}

From \cite{bjornson2017massive}, we know if two UEs shared the same pilot sequence, the correlation of their channels can be defined as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho={} &
\frac{\E\left\{ \left(\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{jA_{j}[k]}\right)^{H}\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{jA_{l}[s]}\right\} }{\sqrt{\E\left\{ \left\Vert \hat{\mathbf{h}}_{jA_{j}[k]}\right\Vert ^{2}\right\} \E\left\{ \left\Vert \hat{\mathbf{h}}_{jA_{l}[s]}\right\Vert ^{2}\right\} }}=\\
& \frac{tr\left(\mathbf{R}_{jA_{j}[k]}\mathbf{R}_{jA_{l}[s]}\mathbf{\Psi}_{jA_{j}[k]}\right)}{\sqrt{tr\left(\mathbf{R}_{jA_{j}[k]}\mathbf{R}_{jA_{j}[k]}\mathbf{\Psi}_{jA_{j}[k]}\right)tr\left(\mathbf{R}_{jA_{l}[s]}\mathbf{R}_{jA_{l}[s]}\mathbf{\Psi}_{jA_{j}[k]}\right)}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Joint Bayesian Channel Estimation}
In order to avoid high inter-cell-interference, we need to obtain channels from all the active UE set, we modify the joint Bayesian channel estimator from \cite{yin2013coordinated}, which estimates channels from all cells simultaneously. By vectorizing the Bayesian channel estimate in the $\zeta$ set, we obtain $\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{\zeta}=[\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{jA_{1}[s_{1}]}^{T}...\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{jA_{L}[s_{L}]}^{T}]^{T},\:s_{l}\in \{\text{UEs in the set } \zeta\}$ 

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{\zeta}^{Bay}=\mathbf{R}_{\zeta}\mathbf{S}^{T}%(\mathbf{S}\mathbf{R}_{\zeta}\mathbf{S}^{T}+\sigma_{n}^{2}\mathbf{I}_{M})^{-1}\mathbf{y}_{jA_{j}[k]},
(\mathbf{S}\mathbf{R}_{\zeta}\mathbf{S}^{T}+\mathbf{I}_{M})^{-1}\mathbf{y}_{jA_{j}[k]},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{R}_{\zeta}=Diag\{\mathbf{R}^{1,1}_{jA_{1}[s_{1}],...,}\mathbf{R}^{L,L}_{jA_{L}[s_{L}]}\} $ and %\:s_{l}\in \{\text{UEs in the set } \zeta\}$ and 
$\mathbf{S}\triangleq[I_{M}...I_{M}]$ is a $M\times ML$ matrix.

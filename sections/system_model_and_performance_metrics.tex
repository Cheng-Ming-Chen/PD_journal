We consider in a $L$-cell massive MIMO network, where a single BS per cell %equips 
with $M$ antennas %and 
serves simultaneously to $K_A$ active UEs. In each network $l$, there are totally $K$ UEs in the UE set $K^l$. In this multi-cell network, we assume the BSs are all synchronized in time and each BS receives the UL pilot signals from all the scheduled UEs in the network.\footnote{The assumption of synchronization between uplink pilots provides a worst
case scenario from a pilot contamination point of view. since any lack of
synchronization will tend to statistically decorrelate the pilots.}

A very often assumed scenario in the massive MIMO society was evaluated in this experiment, similar to the one-ring model \cite{bjornson2017massive}, where the BS located on top of a tall building while all UEs were on the far-field and surrounded by scatters. The scenario fits to the topic of pilot decontamination, as different to the previous  non-line-of-sight (NLoS) measurement \cite{Chen2018pilot}, there is less overlapping in the angular support of this LoS scenario. If the angular support is not sparse, we can actually assume the channel property is closer to the non-correlated channel, and there is no benefit from pilot scheduling\footnote{Please refer to Fig. 3.5 in \cite{bjornson2017massive}, for the uncorrelated fading channel,  there is less impact in upper limit as compared to the correlated channel which overlaps in the angular domain. Moreover, it also shows no difference in pilot scheduling. However, the difference to theoretical one-ring model, from the measured angular transform in Section \ref{results}, the angular support is with irregular shape and spread. To differentiate angular information from different UEs is much more challenging in the measured LoS channel.}.   
\subsection{Outdoor LoS scenario}
An outdoor channel measurement was conducted in building ESAT2 of KU Leuven (KUL) as presented in Fig. \ref{fig:The measured outdoor scenario}. The BS antenna arrays were located $21$m high from the ground and are constructed by patch antennas\cite{chen2017finite}, which were placed with a downtilt angle of $24^\circ$ in order to have a better main directional beam coverage for the UEs. Specifically, we deployed the antenna arrays in two different ways, i.e., collocated in the center as shown in green squares or distributed with a distance of $6.5$m as shown in yellow squares\footnote{The purpose of the two deployments is to collect different channel realizations.}. For each deployment of the BS arrays, we located a total of $36$ UEs on the ground. The center of the distributed UEs were in-line with the center of the BS arrays. Moreover, the $36$ UEs were equally divided into three rows. In each row, there were six two-by-two square meters grids. Note that at one time, we have only two UEs with antenna spacing of around $0.9\lambda$ with the center frequency of $2.61$GHz, located in the center of the grid. At each location, we collected $200$ Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) UL pilot symbols with a time spacing of $100ms$.
\subsection{Hardware and Software}
The KUL massive MIMO testbed as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:BSArrays}  is supported by National Instrument Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs) and is  controlled in real time by LabVIEW Communications MIMO Application Framework 1.1\cite{NIUSRP}. Our system is a distributed massive MIMO testbed which is built up by one main and one slave racks with each consisted of $16$ USRPs. It can support up to overall $64$ radio-frequency (RF) chains. The connection between the main and the slave racks are a $10$m long optical fiber for back-haul and SubMiniature version A (SMA) cables for timing synchronization. We apply directional patch antennas in the BS, the design of the antenna can be refer to \cite{chen2017finite}. 

A special design in the UE is applied in order to increase the sensitivity level of the USRP for the long distance measurement. Specifically, we use off-the-shelf power-range-signal booster as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:UserEquipment} to boost the coverage bi-directionally. The external power amplifier (ext-PA) is $13$dB and the external low noise amplifier (LNA) is $10$dB. Moreover, the transmit/receive (T/R) switch control is sent from USRP by a serial port to the two chips. In this experiment we used dipole antennas for each UE. A TX power of $20$dBm and RX power of $37.5$dB were set in both BS and UE without taking gain from ext-PA/LNA into account.
